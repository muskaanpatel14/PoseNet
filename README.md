You may need to install some dependencies - just pip install everything that it errors on for now

To play:

For Flappy Bird: 
- Run 'python flappybird.py'
- go to flappybird.io, hover your mouse over the frame, and play with your right wrist (configurable)

For Subway Surfers:
- go to https://poki.com/en/g/subway-surfers, and play through the tutorial (we don't have spacebar functionality)
- Run 'python subwaysurfers.py'
- Hold both wrists in the center area, play by moving up/down/left/right
